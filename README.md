### Makefile

For now the Makefile contains only one source :

```makefile
SRCS = srcs/main.c
```

To add other ones, you can either add them directly after the main, like this :

```makefile
SRCS = srcs/main.c \
       srcs/other_file.c
```

Or organize them by ‚Äúcategories‚Äù and add those categories to the SRCS, like this :

```makefile
OTHER_FILES = srcs/other_file.c

SRCS = srcs/main.c \
       ${OTHER_FILES}
```
